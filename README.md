<u><b>R-Rater</b></u>
Reads subtitles from program and prints them on terminal

<B>MAJOR BUGS</B>
<ul>
<li>Program fails for srts of larger than 20 mins.</li>
<li>Program should end with an endl or at last line of subtitles. No extra endl characters etc. should be there, else it doesn't works.</li>
<li>Sometimes some srt files crashes but copy pasting the srt into new text file and saving it as srt works. </li>
<li>Only implemented for windows(YET)</li>
<li>Fails to detect no srt</li>
</ul>
Here is a compressed version of below letter:


1.  Right now this is only available for windows.
2.  You have to drag/drop srt in "WNCC SubTitles/WorkingDirectory/DropHere.lnk"

Future Plans:
  I have almost prepared an os independent version of the same. It is going to have a differnet UI, and I am going to upload it after I check it on some other operating systems.

THE LETTER WITH DETAILS

Dear Reader:

  I hope that this letter finds you in good healths and best of your spirit. I am writing this letter as I am trying to improve my english and my doctor said me to do so. Oh! and there is also one more reason to write this letter. I am going to explain how my program works in detail here.
  
  I am assuming that you TOO wanted this program for sorting the subtitles problem of your GirlFriend. Now, I am assuming that your girlfriend also has windows as OS on her pc. If she does not, then this ain't gonna help her. (I am trying to built the same thing OS independent but its gonna take some time :/ )Ok, so now comming to procedure. First download this rep, and extract it somewhere safe on desktop. Now copy "WNCC Subtitles/Working Directory/" to a pendrive and give it to your girlfriend to copy it to her desktop. Hmp, now tell her to find the srts for all the TV_Series/Movies/Anime/(Cartoons/Serials T_T) to some good accessible locations(most probably desktop). Now tell her to copy the "Working Directory" to the same place. Then tell her to drag the srt of whatever video she wants to play to the "DropHere" link. It should probably start the subtitles. If it doesn't then tell her to open "Setup" folder and drag and drop the srt to "Caller.exe". It SHOULD work. But if it doesn't (Remember I am writing this 'cus I have to improve my english), but if it doesn't Tell her to copy the srt, then open Setup folder, delete aa.srt and paste the srt she copied and then rename that srt to "aa" with extensions "srt" obvio. If it doesn't works, track me down and buy my laptop for $5000 and then repeat the same on my lappy. I guarantee it will work then.
  
  Now that you can solve your gf's pain, What if she asks you how you did this? Now, I don't want credits from your girlfriend. I let you show off. For it let me explain what I did. I used codeLite ide for coding in only C++, for making the program. Compilation was done with MinGW compiler. I use file handeling to read srts and mapped strings and endtime to their start time. Then I ran a simple loop in which I refreshed the screen every 1 second with that seconds subtitles. Simple right? But if you tell this to your gf, she will probably leave you. Tell her that you used your Awesome programming skills and some advanced softwares and integrations to sort her problem. Srusly, if she is searching for subtitle programs, this much information will be enough for her (no offence). 
  
  Hey remember that I don't want credits only in case of girlfriends. In any other case, be it you or your friends sister, I want my proper decent share of credits.
  
  Thats enough bakch%%di for today. Have a nice day and live in peace.
 
 Your Friend,
 Vaibhaw
